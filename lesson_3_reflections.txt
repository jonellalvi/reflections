When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-when working on a collaborative project with multiple contributers
-when working from different devices (like home and work) and you need something in the cloud so you can access from both locations.
-when you might be worried about loosing your local work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- not sure on this one
- maybe to have more granular control over when changes are commited?


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- forks: when you copy a repo from one github account to your own just on github
- fork used when want to make your own changes to someone else's stuff

- clone: when you copy a repo from github to local, or from a local repo to another local repo
- clone used when you want to work locally or when you want to work on a whole nother version

-branch: when you create a new commit  trail
-branch used not really sure 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-so you know where you are in your work?
